This is mcmclib, an open source C library for doing infinite (and finite) dimensional
Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Note: The mcmclib code is released under a permissive BSD licence. However, it
links to FFTW and GSL, which are released under GPL. Thus, the whole caboodle
is GPL'd.

Switching out the linked GPL libraries with BSD libraries is on my todo list.
